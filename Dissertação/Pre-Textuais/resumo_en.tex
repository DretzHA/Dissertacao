\begin{abstract}
Among the various radiofrequency techniques used for obtaining location, such as RSSI, Time of Flight, and Angle of Arrival, which are combined with algorithms to determine the positioning of a target in indoor environments, AoA has been gaining interest since its incorporation into Bluetooth Low Energy 5.1, due to its precision, low energy consumption, low cost, and ease of implementation. This work aims to reduce the estimated position error of a target through multilateration based on RSSI, as well as the estimated position using AoA and RSSI employing stochastic filters, and to propose a system with improved accuracy by using the combined filtered output of both techniques. Thus, it will be possible to have a more precise and efficient BLE 5.1 indoor positioning system compared to other techniques used, which can be used to locate people and assets in indoor environments with low estimation error. To achieve this goal, this work will use a database of real RSSI and AoA measurements from a BLE 5.1 target node and a set of antennas in a 14x8m environment, provided by the academic community, and apply stochastic filters to the AoA and RSSI localization algorithms to reduce estimation error. Errors will be calculated using the RMSE, and the results will be compared with those in the literature. It is expected to achieve high accuracy in estimating the location of a target using RSSI and AoA and the proposed combined system will achieve a lower location error than separate systems. The indoor localization technique presented in this work can be used to replace high-cost or low-precision positioning system in several applications in industries, healthcare, commerce, logistics, and other areas.
